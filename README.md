# GeoQuiz

The program represents a geography quiz. The code was written in pure JavaScript. The quiz consists of three parts: flag guessing, listing all countries of a specific continent in the shortest time possible, and an interactive map for displaying country, capital, and flag information.

In the flag guessing section, users are presented with flags, and they need to guess the corresponding countries. The listing part challenges users to list all countries of a given continent within a limited time frame. Lastly, the interactive map allows users to explore countries by displaying country names, capital cities, and flags.

The program aims to test and enhance users' knowledge of geography.
